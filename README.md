# AHX Web Music Player
A web interface demonstrating AHX playback in JS using Web Audio API, IndexedDB and JSZip. Tested in Chrome/Firefox.

### Jambon Disclaimer

This is a modified version that please jambonbill.

It allow a shorter bufferSize in order to follow internal tracker logic without missing too many steps, and achieve demofx-syncronisation

Also a tiny wrapper to make it nicer, according to me.
